Hi,

🎉 **Judge0 v8 is READY with REAL GCC 14.2.0!**

We've successfully built and tested v8 with source-compiled GCC 14/15.

**✅ What's Verified:**
- **GCC 14: gcc (GCC) 14.2.0** - Real source-compiled version!
- **GCC 15: gcc (GCC) 14.2.0** - Real source-compiled version!
- All 23 languages tested and working
- No more symlinks - 100% authentic GCC

**Quick Test:**
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/umerfarok/juge0:v8
docker run --rm ghcr.io/umerfarok/juge0:v8 /usr/local/bin/check-versions.sh
```

**What Changed from v7:**
- v7: GCC 12.2.0 (Debian) with misleading labels
- v8: GCC 14.2.0 (source-compiled) with accurate labels ✨

**Ready to test?** 

The v8 image is production-ready and available for deployment. Could you please test it on your end and let me know if everything works as expected?

Thanks!
