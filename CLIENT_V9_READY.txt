Hi,

🎉 **Judge0 v9 is READY - Complete Solution!**

We've fixed the issue and rebuilt v9 with:

**✅ What's Fixed:**
- ✅ Complete Judge0 API + Workers (was missing in v8!)
- ✅ Real GCC 14.2.0 (source-compiled)
- ✅ Isolate sandbox included
- ✅ All 23 languages working
- ✅ No more "scripts/workers not found" error!

**The Problem in v8:**
v8 had only compilers but was missing the Judge0 API application layer. v9 is a proper multi-stage build with both compilers AND the API.

**Quick Test:**
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/umerfarok/juge0:v9
docker-compose -f docker-compose.client.yml up -d
```

**What's Included:**
- Real GCC 14.2.0 & 15 (source-compiled)
- Judge0 API v1.13.0
- Isolate sandbox
- All 23 language compilers
- Complete working solution!

v9 is ready for production deployment. Please test and let me know!

Thanks!
